                <h2>My Passion</h2>
                My Passion were an English band formed in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England in 2005.<br>
                They released their debut album, Corporate Flesh Party, in May 2009 on Cool Green Recordings.<br>
                Produced by John Mitchell at Outhouse Studios in Reading.<br>
                the album features eleven tracks, six of which are re-released versions of older demos either presented only on the band's MySpace,<br>
                or released on their Style Suicide record label.<br>
                In April 2010, My Passion re-joined John Mitchell at Outhouse to record their second album, titled Inside This Machine.<br>
                It was initially slated in Autumn 2010, however it was finally released on 25 April 2011 through Spinefarm Records, which the band signed to in early 2011.<br>
                They also have a fan base which was created in 2010 called the 'My Passion Army' which was created by fans.
